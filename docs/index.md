# EPSim: Emergent Policy Simulator

EPSim is a powerful simulation framework designed to model and analyze emergent behaviors in complex policy systems. It combines advanced mathematical modeling with practical policy analysis to provide insights into how different policies might affect system-wide outcomes.

## Features

- **Complex System Modeling**: Simulate intricate policy environments with multiple interacting agents
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluate the effectiveness of different policy interventions
- **Emergent Behavior Analysis**: Identify and analyze emergent patterns in complex systems
- **Visualization Tools**: Comprehensive tools for visualizing simulation results
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy-to-extend architecture for implementing custom models
