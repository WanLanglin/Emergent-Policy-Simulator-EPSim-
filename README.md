# EPSim (Emergent Policy Simulator)

A quantum-classical hybrid optimization framework for policy manifold learning and simulation.

## Overview

EPSim combines quantum annealing techniques with geometric algebra to optimize policies on Riemannian manifolds. The framework implements novel approaches to parallel transport and hyperbolic attention mechanisms.

## Key Features
